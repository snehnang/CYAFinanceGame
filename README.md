# CYAFinanceGame
## Inspiration
We wanted a fun way to see how other people would respond to questions about their spending and saving habits.

## What it does
Our game gives users a sum of money and prompts them with questions about their day. Users decide whether they should save or spend the money and by how much. At the end of the day, users can see how much money they lost or gained that day.

## How we built it
We built our game using Python and made it so that users can play the game directly in the shell by running the program.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues using Thunkable to create our app due to slow internet, so we had to use a Thonny shell to run our program instead. Another challenge we faced was figuring out how to make our program effective, but concise. We noticed we had a lot of redundant code, so we defined multiple functions instead.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how creative and realistic our prompts were, but we're also proud of ourselves for completing it in the given time frame.

## What we learned
We learned how to collaborate our contributions to our program using GitHub. We had no prior experience with the platform and decided to try it out for this hackathon.

## What's next for Choose Your Own Adventure Financial Game
If we had more time, we would have added our program into a web app using Thunkable. We would also add more branches to the prompts so there are more ways for users to go about their day.
